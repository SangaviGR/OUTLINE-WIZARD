# OUTLINE-WIZARD
The Outline of a file contains Topic, Sections, Subsections of the file.
Trees are implemented using linked lists. These lists have nodes that arenâ€™t stored at adjacent or neighboring memory locations
and are linked to each other through parent child relationship associated with trees.
The file outline can help you browse the file structure to some specific part of a file. 
Clicking a node scrolls the file content to the respective heading or Work Item.
When you are editing content in the file body, the nearest parent heading or title is selected.
